# Torchbox Technical Assignment

## Comments

Some issues encountered:

 - Bug: It is possible to move a ticket from one project to another by altering the URL on the edit ticket page. This should not be allowed. Incomplete
 - Feature: Ticket Comments partially complete. I was unable to figure out how to place these comment objects into the currently existing ticket view.
