#  * PYTHONUNBUFFERED - This is useful so Python does not hold any messages

#  * PYTHONPATH - enables use of django-admin command.
#  * DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE - default settings used in the container.
#  * PORT - default port used. Please match with EXPOSE so it works on Dokku.
#    Heroku will ignore EXPOSE and only set PORT variable. PORT variable is
#    read/used by Gunicorn.
#  * WEB_CONCURRENCY - number of workers used by Gunicorn. The variable is
#    read by Gunicorn.
#  * GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS - additional arguments to be passed to Gunicorn. This
#    variable is read by Gunicorn
